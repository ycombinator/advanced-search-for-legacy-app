# Advanced Search for your Legacy Application
## Step 4: Add search to your application

At the end of step 3 the contacts in Elasticsearch are in sync with those in
MySQL. Now we are ready to add search capability to your application. Specifically, we will:
- Add a new API to your application to perform searches: `GET /api/contacts/search`
- Add a text box on the home page where users can enter their search terms
- Show search results on the home page

## Next Step

The next (and final!) step is [Step 5](../../tree/step-5-cleanup). In this step we will cleanup a very small bit of transient code we added in step 3.
